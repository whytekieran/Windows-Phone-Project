Windows-Phone-Project
=====================

Ferrari Application, this app has been published on the windows phone app store. This is a slightly earlier version than the one published. Unfortunetly the latest version was lost, if you remember being with me when that happened in class that day. But this version is exactly the same, the only thing missing are the images that i uploaded to the manifest file to make it acceptable for publish. Otherwise its exactly the same from a functionality point of view. :)
